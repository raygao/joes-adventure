## Description
The book talks about using math logic to optimize GenAI for the rapidly application construction. It introduces SCRIPT (Subject Creates Relevant, Impactful and Polished Technology) - a methodology for iterative GenAI prompt engineering. While the technology stack is following, one could use this methodology (language agnostic) with any programming languages.
The underlying technology is:
- NodeJS: ExpressJS & NextJS
- Docker, Helm Chart & Kubernetes

In essense, it discusses, how to reducing (breaking down) long prompts into parts.

  - Primary and Secondary Viewpoints
- Starting Point, where to start
  - Dart on the Wall
  - Educated Guess
  - Doctrine (Exampling)
- Contextual (boundaries) and strategies
  - Context Broadening
